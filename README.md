ðŸš€Big dream

Leading investment projects and startups made me realize that I was always dependent on developers and professionals in the field of software engineering. To become a complete leader I started to study technologies and methodologies necessary to lead a team of developers as a developer, and my objective turned out to be part of an ecosystem of professionals committed to developing new businesses, innovation, different strategies and identifying great investment opportunities, whether social or in order to profit.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on my startup project, Corp Insider

ðŸŒ± Right now i'm working on building experience and knowledge as a DevSecOps
